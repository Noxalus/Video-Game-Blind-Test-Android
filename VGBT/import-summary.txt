ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* jni\
* jni\includes\
* jni\includes\AGSClientCommonInterface.h
* jni\includes\AchievementsClientInterface.h
* jni\includes\GameCircleClientInterface.h
* jni\includes\LeaderboardsClientInterface.h
* jni\includes\PlayerClientInterface.h
* jni\includes\WhispersyncClientInterface.h
* jni\libAmazonGamesJni.so
* src\
* src\placeholder.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => gameCircleSDK\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\AmazonInsights-android-sdk-2.1.26.jar => gameCircleSDK\libs\AmazonInsights-android-sdk-2.1.26.jar
* libs\gamecirclesdk.jar => gameCircleSDK\libs\gamecirclesdk.jar
* libs\login-with-amazon-sdk.jar => gameCircleSDK\libs\login-with-amazon-sdk.jar
* res\ => gameCircleSDK\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
